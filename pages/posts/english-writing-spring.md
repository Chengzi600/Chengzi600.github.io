### New Year's Eve Customs

New Year's Eve is a symbol of the end of the lunar year and the beginning of a new year. On this day, people always prepare to welcome the coming New Year, such as cleaning houses, preparing New Year's goods, and setting off *firecrackers*.

*Moreover*, the most important thing is having New Year’s Eve Dinner. Families see New Years Eve as a time to get together and usually celebrate with a big family meal. The main dish of this meal is almost always fish. This is because in Chinese, "fish" is a symbol of "every year, more and more".

### New Year's Greetings

On the morning of the Spring Festival, people get up early and wear new clothes. After that, people go out to visit friends and elders. Then, people greet them with “Happy New Year” , “Good health” or “Long life”. Nowadays, however, many people prefer to stay at home, so they usually send wishes to friends online.

### Lucky Money

Lucky Money is also known as “hongbao”. People put money in red *envelopes* as a gift. And children usually get it from their family, as it is a symbol of long life and good luck.

All in all, the Spring Festival is an unforgettable memory and a beautiful picture of life. It is also a very important part of the Chinese culture. We should try to inherit it, shouldn't we?
