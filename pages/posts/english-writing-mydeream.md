    Hello, everyone. First, I'm very happy to be here today to share my dream with you.I have a dream that technology will lead us to a better future.
    Throughout history, technology has been a symbol of progress. A famous example is the invention of the Internet, which has made it possible to stay connected with others from anywhere in the world.

<!-- more -->

    I dream of a future with more and more robots. Today there are already robots working in factories. They do simple jobs over and over again. However, I think robots will wake up and be able to talk to us in the future. They will not only be able to cook but also sing and dance.
    Besides robots, I dream that one day we’ll find new energy. At that time, there will be almost no pollution in the world. What’s more, the world will be more peaceful as no one will fight over energy.
    However, many people think these ideas are impossible, but computers and rockets also seemed impossible 100 years ago. So we never know what will happen in the future. I’ll try my best to study science and never give up. Maybe I will become a scientist and make my own robots.
    That’s all for my dream. Wish me luck, thank you!
